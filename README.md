# 2D Android Game
*A 2D Mobile game for my elective exam during the Computer Science associates degree.*

### Joybot: The Game
Joybot: The Game, is a simple 2D platformer where you have to collect coins and a key to unlock the next level.
It had some basic mechanics such as:
- Jumping
- WASD-movement
- Interacting with objects
- Sound Effects
- 2D Sprite Animations

### Software
- Unity3D
- Visual Studio 2017
- GIMP
---
I ended up publishing the game on Google (has taken it down since then). To get a feel of getting a game going from start to finish.

Got a B for the project in "Android Development". 
### Things I'd improve
If I'd had more time for the actual programming and game development I'd have added more features such as:
- More levels
- More playable characters
- More variety in environmental design

Might one day go back and edit the game.
